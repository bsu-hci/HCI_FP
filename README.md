# HCI Final Project
By: Austin Foster
# Build Week 2 Specifications
Built in [Dart](https://dart.dev/) using the [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) framework

### Memo
This week's work was by far the hardest work that I have done with flutter in a while. It was the most complicated I have got with the language is really what I mean. The final product is not much of an application, rather a section about a participant's content and the different options available to you. I tried my hardest to abide by the Gestalt Principles and design heuristics that we have learned about in the past, but I really did not have much of a code base so there was not really much for me to document as far as that goes. Either way I am somewhat happy with the result and I am learning how to use these development tools more and more as time goes on just like Godot Engine in CS315. As is, the project I have created will most likely not find its way into the official Consortium Application, but serves as a general purpose template for what a comment section would look like. Also I tried my darndest to get the github pages working and not just show a blank white screen. I could not figure out why it would not compile and show up on screen so I gave up on that. Hopefully cloning my project will be just fine.
